## 2. Comparative Assessment  

- **Local Coverage:** PayU and Mercado Pago lead in depth of integration with banks and popular methods (PSE, Baloto, Efecty).  
- **Speed and Cost:** Mural Pay with low commissions (<1%) and near-instant settlements is beneficial for B2B payouts; Wompi provides instant payouts within Bancolombia.  
- **API Flexibility:** Rapyd/Ebanx and Kushki offer the most "ready" SDKs and complex checkouts for multi-channel platforms.  
- **SME Focus:** ePayco and PlacetoPay provide fast launch with minimal entry threshold and local support.  
- **Informal Sector:** Nequi and DaviPlata cover small sellers and Gen Z without bank accounts.  

## 3. Competitive Strategy Recommendations  

1. **Unique Proposition:** combine local methods (PSE, Baloto, Efecty), stable anti-fraud system and hybrid settlements (fiat + stablecoin).  
2. **Pricing:** offer floating rates from 1.8% for cards and 0.8% for B2B-stablecoin payouts with volumes from $100,000/month, maintaining 99.9% SLA.  
3. **Technology Platform:** API-first, modular microservice architecture, ready SDKs for JS/PHP/Python, self-configuring checkout.  
4. **Support and Compliance:** dedicated local support in Spanish, round-the-clock monitoring of SFC and PCI DSS compliance.  
5. **Go-to-market:**  
   - Partnerships with delivery platforms (e.g., Rappi), marketplaces and aggregators through revenue-share model.  
   - Early access program and discounts for first 50 SME clients.  
   - Focus on custom integrations (white-label checkout).  

This strategy will allow your PSP not only to compete with already established players, but also to occupy an attractive niche for medium transactional businesses in Colombia.
